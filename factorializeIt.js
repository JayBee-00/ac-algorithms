//Challenge time! 
//Return the factorial of the provided integer.

// If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

// For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

// Check out Arithmetic Operators https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators

function factorializeIt(num) {
  var factVar = 1;
  for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++){
  factVar = factVar * i;
}
  return factVar;
}

var factAnswer = factorializeIt(5);


// Input: a number
// Output: a number, the factorial of that number which means the product of all the numbers between 1 and that number
// Use a variable to store the output (the product)
// Multiplication operator (*)
// Is that a JS method that calculations a factorial?
// Loop: we need to start at 1 and end at the number that is the parameter, and instead of adding each time in the loop, we can multiply


num.length()
var i=0; i>0; i*
